# Blog Post or White Paper

If you are not serving as a client for the group final project, you will need to complete the following assignment. The assignment is due Thursday, May 2nd, and consists of a blog post of at least 500 words on a topic related to the course. The blog post should be written not for consumption by me, but for an actual audience on a public-facing blog, such as your own blog, the Digital Fellows, a CUNY blog, or as a guest post on a blog you follow. The post does not need to be published by May 2nd, but you should have the target audience in mind as you write.

Suggested topics for the post:

- Create a tutorial based on something you did for the course, such as how to use Jekyll to create a course site.
- Research an area that came up in the course, such as an investigation of the state of website accessibility in the non-profit sector or the ethics of educational technology platforms such as Blackboard.
- Give an account of a challenge you faced learning a particular technical or non-technical skill.
- Read the rest of a book we covered in the course and provide a response or review.
- Interview someone who works with, or teaches, programming, design, or technology.

We can work together to find places to publish your work. You can also band together with other students and create a mini-book or tutorial series, if you prefer.
