# Final Project Deliverable

For your final project in this course, you will create a reflection on the process you used to work with your client and develop an MVP for their project. The reflection will include narrative summary of your thinking process and the steps you took to collect requirements, iterate on a design, and provide an MVP. You will also reflect on your communication with the client and among your team members, including your decision-making process and how you divided up work.

A few notes:

- The word counts provided below are suggestions, not requirements. If you need a number to shoot for, aim for 2000 words or more.
- The paper is due Monday, May 20th.
- Format your reflection as if you were delivering a report to a client. A well-formatted PDF, a considered GitHub repo or website, or a Word or Google doc are all acceptable. You can send your assignment to me as a link or attachment. Remember that I use a screen reader so text should be selectable, but don't overthink it—I can probably figure it out. I'm not interested in Times New Roman double-spaced 12-point.
- The only part of the reflection that needs to have citations or research is the last section, which requires research and citations. Citations don't need to be formal or academic, but they need to be consistent and helpful. Again, think of a report you are making to a client, one who might want to look up your sources but who doesn't care about MLA or APA.

## Background and Summary (300 words)

Provide background on your client, their project, and your team composition. This section might give context such as self-perceptions of technical skill, previous experience with similar projects, or prior experience among team members working as a group. You might also consider including information on your feelings or affect—was your team apprehensive? Confident?

## Approach and Strategy (500 words)

What was the approach you and your team took toward working with your client? Consider vectors such as:

- Your communications style (Did you meet in person? Take notes? Follow up? Give reports?)
- Your scoping strategy (Did you use MoSCoW? What features did you choose to aim for in the MVP? Was there pushback from the client?)
- Your development strategy (Did you use sprints or meet milestones? Did you use tools for organization? Did you make use of version control?)

This section should summarize your strategy going in. The following sections will describe specifics and evaluate your strategy with the benefit of hindsight.

## Project in Depth (500-1000)

Trace the history of your project as it unfolded. What challenges did you encounter? You may wish to provide short excerpts of team communications or summaries of specific encounters or meetings.

You might want to consider your project in the context of:

- Design. What technical choices did you make over the course of the project? What tradeoffs came with your choices?
- Bottlenecks. What limited progress at different times on your project?
- Switchbacks. Were there times you needed to reverse decisions or move the project backward to go forward?
- Optimism/pessimism. Did you find yourself overconfident about completing parts of the project? Or were you not confident enough, and you got things done faster than you thought?

You may wish to provide this narrative detail on your project without evaluation, or you might choose to reflect on your decisions and their implications as you go.

## Research and Evaluation (750-1000)

In this final section of your reflection, you will consider how your process might be improved by drawing on relevant research. In considering how to refine your process, you must draw on the writing of domain experts in process, design, organization, and/or programming. What processes or best practices recommended by these experts might you implement next time?

Starting places for research:
